# Assignments and problems for RUAS Informatica OODP programme.
## What?
Contains all Codegrade assignments for RUAS Informatica.
Not everything is graded 10/10 though.
### But Lessons 7.2, 8.1, 8.2, 9.1, 9.2 and 10.1 aren't there!
That's because those do not exist in the course. Refer to the course manual.
In 2023-2024 these lessons covered the following:
- Explanation about the midterm exam (7.2)
- Revision before the exam (8.1, 8.2)
- The midterm exam (one day, off for the rest of the week)
- Debriefing of the midterm exam (10.1)
### And why is the final assignment (w16) basically empty?
I looked at the assignment and lost my motivation to do it.
## How do I complete this course succesfully?
There's a few things you should do and shouldn't do.
Let's start with the do's:
- Do come to the lessons. The presentations and examples on GitHub are not enough, you need context.
- Do ask your teacher to do live coding sessions if they don't already.
- Do make your class assignments and homework. I know they are huge but just do it.
- Do keep handwritten notes for things you find difficult. You got a little notebook when you did Basecamp so USE IT.
- Do take the mock exams serious, they will show you what you may need to revise.
Now the don'ts:
- Do not work on an assignment for more than two hours at a time. You will lose track of things.
- Do not copy-paste things. Not from AI, not from here, not from anywhere. This will only teach you two shortcuts, but not how to code.
- Do not be afraid to look up things online. If you find something useful, copy it by typing it out yourself. Because you type it out yourself, you will memorise it better.
- Do not be afraid to ask your teacher. They are being paid (partly by you!) to aid you in learning.
- Do not buy the big version of the book by Griffiths unless you're willing to write a lot in it.
- Do not stress out if you get zero or very few points in the midterm. You can still make it up with the endterm.
There is probably much more, but this is what I could come up with. Also note, this seems to work for me, but it might not work for you.
## Alexandra has got you covered.
You can find more in the UNLICENSE file, but here's a short summary:
This is free and unencumbered software released into the public domain.
In which way you reuse my code is up to you, but please consider improving it wherever you see fit.
While it is not forbidden, blatantly copying is almost never a good thing to do.
