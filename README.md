# Assignments and problems for RUAS Informatica OODP programme.
## What?
Contains all Codegrade assignments for RUAS Informatica.
Not everything is graded 10/10 though.
### But Lessons 7.2, 8.1, 8.2, 9.1, 9.2 and 10.1 aren't there!
That's because those do not exist in the course. Refer to the course manual.
In 2023-2024 these lessons covered the following:
- Explanation about the midterm exam (7.2)
- Revision before the exam (8.1, 8.2)
- The midterm exam (one day, off for the rest of the week)
- Debriefing of the midterm exam (10.1)
